Derecom is a music player app for iOS that I have been developing as a passion project in my spare time. It provides an alternative and more colorful interface to the system music player. It allows users to listen to their library, but also stream music, playlists, and radio stations from Apple Music. What I wanted to achieve was a music experience centered around building and maintaining your own music library, and where controlling and managing the playback queue has a prominent role. Derecom Music Player is available on the App Store since June 2019.
