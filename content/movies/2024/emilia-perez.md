In modern-day Mexico, overqualified and exploited lawyer Rita is wasting her talents working for a large firm which is far better at whitewashing criminal garbage than at serving justice. But an unexpected way out appears, the sort of offer that cannot be refused: to help feared cartel boss Juan "Little Hands" Del Monte--aka Manitas--retire from his business and disappear forever. Manitas has a plan he's been fine-tuning in secret for years: to become, at last, the woman he's always dreamed of becoming.
