Cesar Catalina is head of the Development Authority of New Rome. A master architect and city planner, he has a grand, Utopian vision for New Rome - Megalopolis. However, his vision and methods see him fall foul of the city's major, Frank Cicero, resulting in a bitter feud between the two. The major is not the only person Catalina needs to worry about: seeing an opportunity, Catalina's cousin undermines him at every turn in his own bid for power.
